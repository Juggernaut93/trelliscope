Description: Visualization databases (VDBs) provide a way to organize and
    handle large amounts of multi-page visualizations.  This package provides a
    mechanism for easily generating and organizing plots and provides a dynamic
    viewer for tiling displays across the screen and paging through them. There
    is also a mechanism to generate built-in or user-defined "cognostic"
    metrics for each page of a plot, and the viewer has the ability to sort or
    filter the pages based on these cognostics.  This is useful for large
    multi-page displays where it is not possible to view each page, allowing
    only pages with interesting features to be presented.  This package also
    provides a way to meaningfully organize and present these displays in a
    "lab notebook".
