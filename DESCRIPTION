Description: Create, organize, and view
    multi-panel displays against potentially very large data sets.
    Trelliscope extends the ideas of Trellis Display, providing
    a mechanism to easily generate and organize plots, and providing a
    dynamic viewer for tiling panels of a display across the screen and paging
    through them.  There is also a mechanism to generate built-in or
    user-defined "cognostic" metrics for each panel of a display , and the
    viewer has the ability to sort or filter the pages based on these
    cognostics.  This is useful for large multi-panel displays where it is not
    possible to view each panel, allowing only panels with interesting features
    to be presented.  Built upon datadr, Trelliscope displays with millions of
    panels can be created against terabytes of data, but are also very useful
    for small datasets.

a collection of which is called a visualization
    database (VDB)
