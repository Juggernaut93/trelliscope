# Trelliscope: Detailed Visualization of Large Complex Data in R

Trelliscope is an R package to be used in conjunction with [datadr](https://github.com/hafen/datadr) and [RHIPE](https://github.com/saptarshiguha/RHIPE) to provide a framework for detailed visualization of large, complex data.

To get started, see the package documentation and function reference located [here](http://hafen.github.com/trelliscope/).

## Installation

This package will not be submitted to CRAN until it has matured.
 To install this package from github, do the following from the R console:

```s
library(devtools)
install_github("datadr", "hafen")
install_github("trelliscope", "hafen")
```

To use RHIPE with this package, get version 0.74 (unstable branch) from [here](https://github.com/saptarshiguha/RHIPE).

## Notes

This is "research-grade" software, meaning that it is prototypical, potentially buggy, and will likely be changing as design issues are addressed.  While it is being actively used in many projects, the main intent currently for sharing on github is for collaboration on development and not for distribution to the masses.  Use at your own risk.

## License

This software is currently under the BSD license.  Please read the [license](https://github.com/hafen/trelliscope/blob/master/LICENSE.md) document.
