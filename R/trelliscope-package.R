#' trelliscope
#'
#' Trelliscope provides a way to create, organize, and view
#' multi-panel displays, a collection of which is called a visualization
#' database (VDB).  This package provides a mechanism for extending the ideas
#' of Trellis Display to easily generate and organize plots, providing a
#' dynamic viewer for tiling panels of a display across the screen and paging
#' through them. There is also a mechanism to generate built-in or
#' user-defined "cognostic" metrics for each panel of a display , and the
#' viewer has the ability to sort or filter the pages based on these
#' cognostics.  This is useful for large multi-panel displays where it is not
#' possible to view each panel, allowing only panels with interesting features
#' to be presented.
