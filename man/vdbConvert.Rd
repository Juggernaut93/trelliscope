\title{Convert a VDB to be usable with the new Trelliscope viewer}
\usage{
vdbConvert(overwrite = FALSE, basePath = NULL, convertPanels = TRUE,
  jsonp = TRUE, conn = getOption("vdbConn"), autoYes = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{overwrite}{should existing converted files be overwritten? (not implemented)}

\item{basePath}{the base directory to place the converted vdb in (doesn't need to exist)}

\item{convertPanels}{should panels be converted to json for the new viewer? (good to set to FALSE if this has already been done but other aspects of the VDB have changed and need to be re-converted)}

\item{jsonp}{should jsonp files be created instead of json?}

\item{conn}{VDB connection info, typically stored in options("vdbConn") at the beginning of a session, and not necessary to specify here if a valid "vdbConn" object exists}

\item{autoYes}{should questions to proceed with directory creation operations be automatically answered with "yes"?}
